##### Silver top, stainless steel base.

- Does it really make sense to spend $200 on a top? No. Do I still want it? Yes!

### Everdrive GBA Mini

##### Lets me play every GameBoy Advance game there is
- <https://everdrive.me/cartridges/everdrive-gba-x5-mini.html>
- I already have the old version of this, which sticks out from the top. This one is flush!
- I like the graphite color the best, but the translucent smoke is cool too. The red sucks though.
